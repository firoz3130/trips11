The historic center of Venice is divided into six districts, or sestieri, which are named Cannaregio, Castello, Dorsoduro, San Marco, San Polo, and Santa Croce.  Venice is known as the "City of Canals" and is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. The city is famous for its beautiful bridges, gondola rides, atmospheric streets, and carnival celebrations.  Venice has a long and rich history. The city was founded in the 5th century AD by refugees from the mainland who were fleeing from barbarian invasions. Venice became a major trading power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and it was a staging area for the Crusades. The citys decline began in the 18th century, and it was finally annexed by Italy in 1866.  Today, Venice is a popular tourist destination, but it is also facing a number of challenges. The city is sinking at an alarming rate, and it is also struggling to cope with the large number of tourists who visit each year.', // Replace with a description for testing
